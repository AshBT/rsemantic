== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Applying transforms to query vectors
* Detect the optimal dimension reduction in LSA.
* Allow objects to be passed in as transforms.
* Implement Probabilistic latent semantic analysis
* Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation

* Matrix transformer has to popout the matrix of VectorSpace::Model and reassign it, get rid of this.
