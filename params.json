{"body":"# Rsemantic\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/josephwilk/rsemantic.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/rsemantic)\r\n\r\nA Ruby document vector search with flexible matrix transforms. Current supported transforms: \r\n\r\n* Latent semantic analysis\r\n* Term frequency - inverse document frequency\r\n\r\nDocumentation: http://github.com/josephwilk/rsemantic/wikis/home\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n* GSL - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl\r\n* stemmer - http://rubyforge.org/projects/stemmer/\r\n\r\n## INSTALL:\r\n\r\nNote 'brew install GSL' installs 1.15 which is not supported yet by the gsl gem. So you have to switch your GSL version to 1.14.\r\nSee here for details on how to do that with homebrew: http://bretthard.in/2012/03/getting-related_posts-lsi-and-gsl-to-work-in-jekyll/\r\n\r\n<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/josephwilk/rsemantic.git\r\ncd rsemantic\r\nbrew install GSL\r\nbundle install\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n* @josephwilk\r\n* @dominikhonnef\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2008-2012 Joseph Wilk\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Rsemantic","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
